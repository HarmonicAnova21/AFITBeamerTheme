AFIT Beamer Theme
=================
A Beamer theme for AFIT, and general Air Force, presentations.

What?
-----
Beamer is a package for LaTeX that lets you build really nice looking presentations and output them into PDF files.  It's like PowerPoint for LaTeX.

Generally, when building slides, you'll want a theme that looks nice, and is tailored to your organization.  Most Air Force organizations have that PowerPoint file that everyone copies before starting to build their slides.  Those master slides can be difficult to build in LaTeX.

These are the "master slides" you need.  In Beamer, this is called a theme.

Coming soon

Requirements
------------
LaTeX, and Beamer

Installation
------------
Download the tar.gz or whatever, unzip it into your ~/ directory (or ~/Library/ on OS X).  It'll unpack into the texmf directory, which is generally where local themes are stored.

License
-------
A lot of this is copied from Till Tantau's default themes, so most of it has to fall under the licenses he used.  Which is a GPL license.  I'll figure this out better soon.
